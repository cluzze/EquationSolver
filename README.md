# EquationSolver
Hi thanks for trying out my quadratic equation solver
run this program with coefficients of the equation as arguments
you can use floating point numbers with dot or comma
"equation.h\" header provides you with solve_equation() function, which will return Roots struct
Roots.n is the number of roots, Roots.x and Roots.y are roots value, Roots.x > Roots.y
If equation has only one root, it will be stored in Roots.x
